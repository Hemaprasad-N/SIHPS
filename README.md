## Problem Title
E-Waste Facility Locator
## Problem Description
Website that tells you the location of the nearest e-waste collection and recycling facility. Offers educational pop-ups on the harmful components of your e-waste and their effects on the environment and human health if not disposed correctly. There could be an option to input the model of your old device and earn credit points relative to the amount of precious metals recovered from the device if disposed correctly.

Ministry of Environment

## Idea
The idea is to create a website dedicated to promoting responsible e-waste disposal and recycling. The site will help users locate the nearest e-waste collection and recycling facilities, educate them on the environmental and health impacts of improper e-waste disposal, and incentivize proper disposal through a credit point system based on the value of recovered precious metals.
